# End-of-field-challenge

Rebuild interface 01 (simple) and 05 (complex) as a test.  

## Motivation

We made this project to test our knowledge of html and css and see if we are competent enough to rebuild a given interface.
We need to combine what we have learned in the first month of the BeCode training.  

## Details

Interface 01 simple: This is a simple interface of an image and some text. This one is not responsive.  
Interface 05 complex:  

## Tech/Framework used

Made with Visual Studio Code  
Interface 01: no SASS, no frameworks, just custom css.
